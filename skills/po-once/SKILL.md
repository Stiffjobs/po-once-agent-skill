# Po Once Skill

Portable skill bundle for AI agents to automate Po Once through the agent API.

## Setup

Create an API key in Po Once and run the bundled setup command:

```bash
./scripts/po-once.cjs setup --api-key po_live_org_<secret>
```

If setup is needed and you are invoking the script without first switching into the skill directory, run:

```bash
<skill-path>/scripts/po-once.cjs setup --api-key po_live_org_<secret>
```

Base URL selection:

- Keys starting with `po_test_org_` are tried against the test base URL first: `https://dynamic-lapwing-647.convex.site`
- All other org keys, including normal `po_live_org_...` keys, are tried against the production base URL first: `https://fastidious-elephant-379.convex.site`

This prefix-based host selection is a default heuristic, not a guarantee. By default, `setup` verifies the configuration with `accounts` before saving it and may fall back to the other known host if the inferred host does not resolve the agent route correctly.

Override it if needed:

```bash
./scripts/po-once.cjs setup \
  --api-key po_live_org_<secret> \
  --base-url https://your-other-convex-host.convex.site
```

If API calls fail on the inferred host, rerun `setup` with `--base-url`. Use `--no-verify` only when you intentionally want to save the config without testing it first.

Config resolution order:

- `PO_ONCE_AGENT_API_KEY` and optional `PO_ONCE_BASE_URL`
- `--config /absolute/path/to/config.json` or `PO_ONCE_CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.json`
- nearest project `.po-once/config.json`, discovered by walking upward from the current working directory
- global config at `~/.config/po-once/config.json`

That means the helper no longer assumes local config only exists at the current directory root. Running the bundled script from the installed skill directory, a nested repo folder, or another subdirectory is safe as long as the project-local `.po-once/config.json` exists somewhere above the invocation directory.

Use an explicit config path when you need deterministic behavior in automation or CI:

```bash
./scripts/po-once.cjs health --config /absolute/path/to/config.json
PO_ONCE_CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.json ./scripts/po-once.cjs accounts
```

**Note for agents**: All script paths in this document are relative to the directory where this `SKILL.md` is installed. For example, `./scripts/po-once.cjs` refers to the script bundled with this skill, not a repository-root `./scripts/po-once.cjs`. Resolve paths from the installed skill directory.

| `./scripts/po-once.cjs posts:get --id <post_id> --status-only` | Get a minimal status view for one post |
| `./scripts/po-once.cjs posts:delete --id <post_id>` | Delete an eligible scheduled post |

## Account IDs

Agents must call `accounts` before posting unless the user already provided current Po Once `socialProfileId` values. Use the returned `id` or `socialProfileId` as the post target; those values are equivalent for posting.

When running `post` or `publish`, the CLI flag stays named `--accounts` for ergonomics, but it sends those values to the API as `socialProfileIds`. Do not use `accountIds`, `profileIds`, provider-native account IDs, handles, usernames, or display names as post targets.

For Threads keyword discovery, use the `linkedAccountId` returned by `accounts`, not the posting `id`/`socialProfileId`.

If the user gives ambiguous account input, run `accounts` and match by visible metadata such as provider, display name, username, or avatar before choosing the returned `id` or `socialProfileId`.

## Analytics And Discovery

Use `analytics:profile` only after resolving the target account through `accounts`.

- Meta analytics profiles support `--days`, `--period`, `--since`, and `--until`
- TikTok analytics profiles support `--cursor` and `--max-count`
- Do not combine `--days` with `--period`, `--since`, or `--until`
- Do not combine `--period` with `--since` or `--until`
- Do not send `--cursor` or `--max-count` for non-TikTok analytics requests
- When no analytics window is provided for a Meta profile, the helper defaults to `--days 28`
- Compare only like-for-like profiles using the same time window
- Call out missing metrics instead of inferring them

Use `keyword-search` only for Threads linked accounts.

- `--linked-account-id` must come from `accounts`
- the matched account must have provider `threads`
- `--search-type` is optional and must be `TOP` or `RECENT`
- prefer `TOP` unless the user explicitly wants recency

## API Surface

The helper script wraps these endpoints:

- `GET /api/agent/v1/accounts`
- `GET /api/agent/v1/analytics/profiles/:profileId`
- `POST /api/agent/v1/keyword-search`
- `POST /api/agent/v1/media/create-upload-url`
- `POST /api/agent/v1/contents`
- `GET /api/agent/v1/posts`
- `POST /api/agent/v1/posts`
- `GET /api/agent/v1/posts/:id`
- `DELETE /api/agent/v1/posts/:id`

## Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Run `health` if you need to confirm which base URL, config source, and `configPath` are active.
2. Call `accounts` to get valid Po Once social profile IDs and linked account IDs unless the user already provided current values.
3. If the task is analysis, run `analytics:profile` or `keyword-search` instead of fetching unrelated posting data.
4. Use `accounts --provider ... --match ...` to narrow down ambiguous account choices before analysis or posting.
5. Draft content and confirm whether the user wants direct or scheduled posting.
6. Use `publish` for the normal end-to-end posting path.
7. Use `posts` or `posts:get --status-only` to confirm status.
8. Only use `posts:delete` when the user explicitly wants a scheduled post removed.
9. Before deleting, inspect the post first and confirm both `type === "scheduled"` and `status === "scheduled"`.

## Safety Notes

- Treat the API token like a password.
- CLI output redacts common credential fields, but avoid sharing raw command output broadly unless needed.
- Start with `accounts` before using profile analytics, Threads keyword search, or posting endpoints.
- Prefer one explicit request per task instead of fetching every profile.
- Use bounded analytics windows and confirm the returned response window before summarizing performance.
- Prefer scheduled posting unless the user clearly wants immediate publishing.
- Results are scoped to the organization tied to the token.
- If the API returns `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED`, stop and ask the user to upgrade the organization to an active Starter or Pro plan, or switch organizations.
- Only delete a post when both `type === "scheduled"` and `status === "scheduled"`.
- Before calling `DELETE /api/agent/v1/posts/:id`, inspect the post first to confirm it is still scheduled and has not started processing.
- Do not delete direct posts, published posts, failed posts, errored posts, posts already processing, or any post with another `type` or `status`.
- If the post is not still `scheduled`/`scheduled`, do not call delete and tell the user that only scheduled posts that are still in `scheduled` status can be deleted.
